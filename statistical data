The Experiment was conducted after I found out about the fact that completely empty strings of text generated by the text-extraction function 
are not a good detector for scanned and therefore most likely copyright-protected files.
The next best idea i came up with, was to use the length of the extracted string as key-feature for classification. As classificator a naive bayesian classifier was used.

On a small portion of the given dataset classification delivered okay-ish results with 20% failure rate (8% problematic false negatives)


First Experiment:
#################
Naive Bayesian Classification with one single dimension. The data vector consists of a single integer containing the length of the string extracted by pdfminer
Gaussian Distributions are assumed for calculating the probabilities.

Problematic is the high false negative rate of 12%
Examining the files showed no obvious key differences.
Additional dimensions of the data vector may be needed for good classification.

Note: Some files were impossible to open for pdfminer, the files with this problem where in 100% of the cases not copyright protected.
Therefore the unopenable files where all classified as non-copyright

Note: Only 24 positives exist in the small dataset, therefore a error rate for positives is to very high. However positive results are very likely to be correct
